# Robb Fitzsimmons

Robb is a principal at [The Linnaean Company](http://linnaean.co), a consultancy focused on software and data science. Linnaean also operates its own products, including [Proximate](http://proximate.com), an experiential marketing software tool for brands and associations, and a forthcoming tool for investment managers.

Many of his research and commercial projects concern the intersection of persuasion and the scientific method: how companies can use data to define their offering and audience, then evaluate and improve.
